# hello-world
Just starting this Github thing for the first time. I am very green when it comes to code or any of this. Any help is appreciated!
Hi there, I am a 26 year old male from Shreveport, LA and I currently work for Hilton at the Hampton inn & Suites. I have three dogs that I love dearly and I enjoy spending most of my time with them or learning something new(like I am doing now). Thanks for reading.
